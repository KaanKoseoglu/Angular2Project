# Angular 2 assignment

## Note
This is an assignment to create a very basic Angular 2 app. The template that is used is a derivation of the [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) start project 

## Prerequisites
The prerequisites are the same as the [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) project.  

# Description of the assignment

* Start a new angular 2 project (*)

* The data available on following url must be visualized
  [http://www.aarixa.be/assignment_jobs.php](http://www.aarixa.be/assignment_jobs.php)
  
* All the pages must have the aariXa logo

![alt text](http://www.aarixa.be/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/aariXa.png "Logo aariXa")


* Make it possible to filter on the visualized data from the website, you can have a look on our jobpage to see an [example](http://www.aarixa.be/jobs/)
  * It should be possible to filter at least at frontEnd, Java and dotNet
  * Nice to have is search function that is searching on all the JSON content returned form the url

For visualisation it's allowed to use CSS frameworks like [ng-bootstrap](https://github.com/ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap) , [angular2-materialize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular2-materialize),.. or others that support angular.


## (*) How to get started 
This a possible way to start your project, you can start with this project as a template but you can also use your own angularJS 2 quickstart, include the steps that you followed in the Readme.md in your submission

* Get this project on your local machine using command
``` dos
git clone git://github.com/aariXa/ng-be.git
```

* Go to the retrieved directory and run the the package installer
``` dos
cd ng-be
npm install
```
During the npm install you can see errors or warnings, this is normal and this is the same behaviour in the current young angular-cli beta project.


* When you use visual studio code as IDE for development execute
``` dos
code .
```

* Start your developemt server from command line
``` dos
npm start
```

* You can also use the intergrated terminal window in visual studio code to start your development server ( View -> Integrated Terminal)
* When you want to debug in visual studio code you can check the extention [Debugger for Chrome](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2016/02/23/introducing-chrome-debugger-for-vs-code)

* Open your Chrome Browser and go to following url for opening your start page 
``` dos
http://localhost:4200
```
